Finding the right smartphone or accessory can be overwhelming due to the huge variety of products and scattered information. Customers often waste time switching between multiple e-commerce platforms to compare prices, check specifications, and find the best deals. Many end up paying more than necessary or buying products that don’t fully match their needs.

A mobile application dedicated to smartphones and accessories that allows users to sort and filter products according to their preferences, interact with an AI chatbot to get personalized recommendations, compare multiple products side by side, and view real-time price comparisons from various platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and brand websites. The app will also display a price history graph for each product, helping customers decide the best time to buy. The platform will use affiliate links to generate revenue while ensuring users get the best deals.
